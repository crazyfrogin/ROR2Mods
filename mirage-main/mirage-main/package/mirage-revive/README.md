# MirageRevive

A mod that revives a player as a "zombie", spawning a masked enemy when the player dies.  
By default, there is a 10% chance to revive as a masked enemy.

**This mod is required by the host and all non-hosts, and now requires [Mirage](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/qwbarch/Mirage/>) for synced protocol voice playback.**

Note: Only the host's configuration is used (the host's config is synced to non-hosts).

### Alternative mods

If you'd like to explore the "reviving" mechanic but want more options, check out [Zombies](<https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Synaxin/Zombies/>).
