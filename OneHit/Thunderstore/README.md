# Boss Rush: One-Hit World

Adds a selectable Artifact that turns normal stage flow into a boss-focused gauntlet.

## What it does
- All non-boss enemies die in one hit.
- Teleporter/event bosses are excluded from one-hit.
- Teleporter bosses are overclocked (health, damage, attack speed, move speed).
- Teleporter fights scale to multiple bosses by stage/time.
- Overclocked teleporter bosses can blink near players when they lose pressure.

## Default boss-count ramp
- Stage 1: 1 boss
- Stage 2-3: 2 bosses
- Stage 4-5: 3 bosses
- Stage 6+ or 30+ minutes: 4 bosses

## Tuning
Config entries are available for overclock multipliers, blink timing/range, and optional non-boss outgoing damage reduction.
